* Introduction
Organizing Data for processing is an essential step in the development  of a computer program. For many applications, the choice of the proper data structure is the only major decision involved in the implementation: once the choice has been mad, the necessary algorithms are simple. 

The choices of algorithm and of data structures are closely intertwined, and we continually seek ways to save time or space by making the choice properly.

A data structure is not a passive object: We must also consider the operations to be performed on it (and the algorithms used for these operations). 

The above concept is formalized in the notion of a data type.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
"In general, we can think of data as defined by some collection
of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that 
these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation."

This section considers basic organizations and methods for manipulating data.
