### Use Intention-Revealing Names

### Class Names
Class names should be **noun phrases** (e.g. Customer, AddressParser).

### Method Names
Method names should be **verb phrases** (e.g. deletePage).

### Don't Pick Clever Names
Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

### Pick One Word per Concept
Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it (e.g. get, retrieve, fetch are confusing if all used in same
codebase just choose one).
